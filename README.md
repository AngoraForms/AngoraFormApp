# Angora Form APP
The Angora Form APP is an extension of the AngoraForm NPM library with the same mission to make creating reactive form in Angular easier.

Instead of creating a custom components solely through code, the website allows interactivity with a GUI.

See [our website] or below for example code comparison.

## Key Features
- Landing Page for the Angora Form ecosystem, including documentation for NPM package.
- Creation of Angular form typescript code and html code through a GUI interface including aspects such as error handling and validations.
- Saving and deleting of codes made through the GUI interface

## Upcoming Features
- Borrow general reusable form components made through the Angora Forms.
- Ability to save and reuse Angora Form code.

## Getting Started
1. Create an account to allow full access to AngoraForm App's full functionality. However you do not need an account to access the GUI interface
2. Navigate to form builder to create your typescript and html Angular form component!
3. Use the save template button to save the generated form if logged in.
4. If user is logged in, visit the component bank to retrieve any saved components previously.
