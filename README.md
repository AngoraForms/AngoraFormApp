# Angora Form Builder app
The Angora Form Builder app is an extension of the Angora Forms NPM library, with the same mission to make creating reactive forms in Angular easier.

Instead of creating custom components solely through code, the Form Builder app allows for interactivity through a GUI.

See https://www.angoraforms.com/ or below for example code comparison.

## Key Features
- Landing Page for the Angora Forms ecosystem, including documentation for NPM package.
- Creation of Angular form's typescript code and html code through a GUI interface including aspects such as error handling and validations.
- Saving and deleting of code made through the GUI interface.

## Upcoming Features
- Borrow generic reusable form components made through the Angora Form Builder.

## Getting Started
1. Create an account to access the Angora Form Builder app's full functionality. However, you do not need an account to access the GUI interface.
2. Navigate to the Form Builder to create your typescript and html Angular form component!
3. Use the 'save template' button to save your custom form.
4. Visit the 'component bank' to retrieve any previously saved components.

## Other Information

Angora Forms is in beta and will be updated in the future. 
You should also take a look at the [NPM package repo](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/angora-forms/) and the official library on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/forms?activeTab=readme)
